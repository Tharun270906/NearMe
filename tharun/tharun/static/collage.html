    <p align="justify">Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, is one of Indiaâ€™s most prestigious medical institutions, known for its excellence in medical education, research, and healthcare. It was founded in 1900 by Dr. Ida S. Scudder, an American missionary, who was inspired to provide quality healthcare to the underserved population of South India. CMC began as a small clinic and gradually grew into a world-renowned institution offering undergraduate, postgraduate, and super-specialty medical education. It is affiliated with the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University. The hospital is known for its compassionate, patient-centered care and serves millions of patients each year, regardless of their socio-economic status. CMC also emphasizes community outreach and rural health programs. Its pioneering achievements include the first reconstructive surgery for leprosy in the world and India's first successful open-heart surgery. Today, CMC Vellore continues to lead in medical innovation, ethical practice, and holistic healing.</p>
